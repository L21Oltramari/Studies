# Your task is to write your own function, which behaves almost exactly like the original split() method, i.e.:
# it should accept exactly one argument â€“ a string;
# it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces;
# if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list;
# its name should be mysplit()

                lst.append(word)
